# discordAnimeBot
This is my first discord bot, it will be temporarily hosted on AWS EC2, it is currently on development and will have nothing of general interest.
Right now it connects to MongoDB Atlas and reacts to certain keywords returning a quote retrieved from a collection.
My future plans about it are create a bridge with SocketIO/ElectronJS/RobotJS in order to automate the usage of TupperBox discord bot without selfhosting a modified version of it
Also i plan of coding some kinda minigame
